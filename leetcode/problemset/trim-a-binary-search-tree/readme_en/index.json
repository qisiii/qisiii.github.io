Trim a Binary Search Tree Description Given the root of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as low and high, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [low, high]. Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node\u0026#39;s descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a unique answer.\nReturn the root of the trimmed binary search tree. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [1,0,2], low = 1, high = 2 Output: [1,null,2] Example 2:\nInput: root = [3,0,4,null,2,null,null,1], low = 1, high = 3 Output: [3,2,null,1] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104]. 0 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 104 The value of each node in the tree is unique. root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree. 0 \u0026lt;= low \u0026lt;= high \u0026lt;= 104 Related Topics Tree Depth-First Search Binary Search Tree Binary Tree Similar Questions "}
