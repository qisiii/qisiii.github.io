Minimum Path Sum Description Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.\nNote: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]] Output: 7 Explanation: Because the path 1 \u0026rarr; 3 \u0026rarr; 1 \u0026rarr; 1 \u0026rarr; 1 minimizes the sum. Example 2:\nInput: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] Output: 12 \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nm == grid.length n == grid[i].length 1 \u0026lt;= m, n \u0026lt;= 200 0 \u0026lt;= grid[i][j] \u0026lt;= 200 Related Topics Array Dynamic Programming Matrix Similar Questions Unique Paths Dungeon Game Cherry Pickup Minimum Path Cost in a Grid Maximum Number of Points with Cost Minimum Cost Homecoming of a Robot in a Grid Paths in Matrix Whose Sum Is Divisible by K Check if There is a Path With Equal Number of 0\u0026rsquo;s And 1\u0026rsquo;s Minimum Cost of a Path With Special Roads "}
