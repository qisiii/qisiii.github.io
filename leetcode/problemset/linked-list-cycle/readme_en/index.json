Linked List Cycle Description Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.\nThere is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the\u0026nbsp;next\u0026nbsp;pointer. Internally, pos\u0026nbsp;is used to denote the index of the node that\u0026nbsp;tail\u0026#39;s\u0026nbsp;next\u0026nbsp;pointer is connected to.\u0026nbsp;Note that\u0026nbsp;pos\u0026nbsp;is not passed as a parameter.\nReturn\u0026nbsp;true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1 Output: true Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed). Example 2:\nInput: head = [1,2], pos = 0 Output: true Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node. Example 3:\nInput: head = [1], pos = -1 Output: false Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104]. -105 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 105 pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list. \u0026nbsp;\nFollow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?\nRelated Topics Hash Table Linked List Two Pointers Similar Questions Linked List Cycle II Happy Number "}
