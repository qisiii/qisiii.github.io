Add Two Numbers Description You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum\u0026nbsp;as a linked list.\nYou may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4] Output: [7,0,8] Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807. Example 2:\nInput: l1 = [0], l2 = [0] Output: [0] Example 3:\nInput: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9] Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100]. 0 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 9 It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
