Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String Description You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. A duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters and removing them.\nWe repeatedly make duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.\nReturn the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It can be proven that the answer is unique.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: s = \u0026quot;abbaca\u0026quot; Output: \u0026quot;ca\u0026quot; Explanation: For example, in \u0026quot;abbaca\u0026quot; we could remove \u0026quot;bb\u0026quot; since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move. The result of this move is that the string is \u0026quot;aaca\u0026quot;, of which only \u0026quot;aa\u0026quot; is possible, so the final string is \u0026quot;ca\u0026quot;. Example 2:\nInput: s = \u0026quot;azxxzy\u0026quot; Output: \u0026quot;ay\u0026quot; \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= s.length \u0026lt;= 105 s consists of lowercase English letters.
