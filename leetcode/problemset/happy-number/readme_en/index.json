Happy Number Description Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.\nA happy number is a number defined by the following process:\nStarting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits. Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy. Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 19 Output: true Explanation: 12 + 92 = 82 82 + 22 = 68 62 + 82 = 100 12 + 02 + 02 = 1 Example 2:\nInput: n = 2 Output: false \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 231 - 1 Related Topics Hash Table Math Two Pointers Similar Questions Linked List Cycle Add Digits Ugly Number Sum of Digits of String After Convert Minimum Addition to Make Integer Beautiful Smallest Value After Replacing With Sum of Prime Factors Count the Digits That Divide a Number "}
