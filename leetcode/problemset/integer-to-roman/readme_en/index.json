Integer to Roman Description Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:\nSymbol Value I 1 V 5 X 10 L 50 C 100 D 500 M 1000 Roman numerals are formed by appending\u0026nbsp;the conversions of\u0026nbsp;decimal place values\u0026nbsp;from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:\nIf the value does not start with 4 or\u0026nbsp;9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral. If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the\u0026nbsp;subtractive form\u0026nbsp;representing\u0026nbsp;one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example,\u0026nbsp;4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV\u0026nbsp;and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX.\u0026nbsp;Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX),\u0026nbsp;40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM). Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5\u0026nbsp;(V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol\u0026nbsp;4 times\u0026nbsp;use the subtractive form. Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: num = 3749\nOutput: \u0026quot;MMMDCCXLIX\u0026quot;\nExplanation:\n3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) 700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C) 40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L) 9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X) Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places Example 2:\nInput: num = 58\nOutput: \u0026quot;LVIII\u0026quot;\nExplanation:\n50 = L 8 = VIII Example 3:\nInput: num = 1994\nOutput: \u0026quot;MCMXCIV\u0026quot;\nExplanation:\n1000 = M 900 = CM 90 = XC 4 = IV \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= num \u0026lt;= 3999 Related Topics Hash Table Math String Similar Questions Roman to Integer Integer to English Words "}
