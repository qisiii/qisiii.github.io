Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted Description Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 \u0026lt;= index1 \u0026lt; index2 \u0026lt;= numbers.length.\nReturn the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.\nThe tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.\nYour solution must use only constant extra space.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 Output: [1,2] Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2]. Example 2:\nInput: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6 Output: [1,3] Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3]. Example 3:\nInput: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1 Output: [1,2] Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2]. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n2 \u0026lt;= numbers.length \u0026lt;= 3 * 104 -1000 \u0026lt;= numbers[i] \u0026lt;= 1000 numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order. -1000 \u0026lt;= target \u0026lt;= 1000 The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.
