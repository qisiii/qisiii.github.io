N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal Description Given the root of an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes\u0026#39; values.\nNary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal. Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6] Output: [1,3,5,6,2,4] Example 2:\nInput: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14] Output: [1,2,3,6,7,11,14,4,8,12,5,9,13,10] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104]. 0 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 104 The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000. \u0026nbsp;\nFollow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?\nRelated Topics Stack Tree Depth-First Search Similar Questions Binary Tree Preorder Traversal N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal "}
