Path Sum II Description Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals targetSum. Each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not node references.\nA root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22 Output: [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]] Explanation: There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum: 5 + 4 + 11 + 2 = 22 5 + 8 + 4 + 5 = 22 Example 2:\nInput: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5 Output: [] Example 3:\nInput: root = [1,2], targetSum = 0 Output: [] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000]. -1000 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 1000 -1000 \u0026lt;= targetSum \u0026lt;= 1000 Related Topics Tree Depth-First Search Backtracking Binary Tree Similar Questions Path Sum Binary Tree Paths Path Sum III Path Sum IV Step-By-Step Directions From a Binary Tree Node to Another "}
