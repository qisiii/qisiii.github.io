Merge Intervals Description Given an array\u0026nbsp;of intervals\u0026nbsp;where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]] Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]] Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6]. Example 2:\nInput: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]] Output: [[1,5]] Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= intervals.length \u0026lt;= 104 intervals[i].length == 2 0 \u0026lt;= starti \u0026lt;= endi \u0026lt;= 104 Related Topics Array Sorting Similar Questions Insert Interval Meeting Rooms Meeting Rooms II Teemo Attacking Add Bold Tag in String Range Module Employee Free Time Partition Labels Interval List Intersections Amount of New Area Painted Each Day Longest Substring of One Repeating Character Count Integers in Intervals Divide Intervals Into Minimum Number of Groups Determine if Two Events Have Conflict Count Ways to Group Overlapping Ranges Points That Intersect With Cars Count Days Without Meetings "}
