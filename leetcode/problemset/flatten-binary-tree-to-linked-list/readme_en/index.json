Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List Description Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a \u0026quot;linked list\u0026quot;:\nThe \u0026quot;linked list\u0026quot; should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null. The \u0026quot;linked list\u0026quot; should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree. \u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6] Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6] Example 2:\nInput: root = [] Output: [] Example 3:\nInput: root = [0] Output: [0] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000]. -100 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 100 \u0026nbsp;\nFollow up: Can you flatten the tree in-place (with O(1) extra space)?
