Sort an Array Description Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.\nYou must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [5,2,3,1] Output: [1,2,3,5] Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5). Example 2:\nInput: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0] Output: [0,0,1,1,2,5] Explanation: Note that the values of nums are not necessairly unique. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 5 * 104 -5 * 104 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 5 * 104 Related Topics Array Divide and Conquer Bucket Sort Counting Sort Radix Sort Sorting Heap (Priority Queue) Merge Sort Similar Questions "}
