Removing Minimum Number of Magic Beans Description You are given an array of positive integers beans, where each integer represents the number of magic beans found in a particular magic bag.\nRemove any number of beans (possibly none) from each bag such that the number of beans in each remaining non-empty bag (still containing at least one bean) is equal. Once a bean has been removed from a bag, you are not allowed to return it to any of the bags.\nReturn the minimum number of magic beans that you have to remove.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: beans = [4,1,6,5] Output: 4 Explanation: - We remove 1 bean from the bag with only 1 bean. This results in the remaining bags: [4,0,6,5] - Then we remove 2 beans from the bag with 6 beans. This results in the remaining bags: [4,0,4,5] - Then we remove 1 bean from the bag with 5 beans. This results in the remaining bags: [4,0,4,4] We removed a total of 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 beans to make the remaining non-empty bags have an equal number of beans. There are no other solutions that remove 4 beans or fewer. Example 2:\nInput: beans = [2,10,3,2] Output: 7 Explanation: - We remove 2 beans from one of the bags with 2 beans. This results in the remaining bags: [0,10,3,2] - Then we remove 2 beans from the other bag with 2 beans. This results in the remaining bags: [0,10,3,0] - Then we remove 3 beans from the bag with 3 beans. This results in the remaining bags: [0,10,0,0] We removed a total of 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 beans to make the remaining non-empty bags have an equal number of beans. There are no other solutions that removes 7 beans or fewer. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= beans.length \u0026lt;= 105 1 \u0026lt;= beans[i] \u0026lt;= 105 Related Topics Greedy Array Enumeration Prefix Sum Sorting Similar Questions Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero "}
