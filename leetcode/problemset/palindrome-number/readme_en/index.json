Palindrome Number Description Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: x = 121 Output: true Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left. Example 2:\nInput: x = -121 Output: false Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome. Example 3:\nInput: x = 10 Output: false Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n-231\u0026nbsp;\u0026lt;= x \u0026lt;= 231\u0026nbsp;- 1 \u0026nbsp;\nFollow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
