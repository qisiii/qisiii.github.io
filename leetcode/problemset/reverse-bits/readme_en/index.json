Reverse Bits Description Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.\nNote:\nNote that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer\u0026#39;s internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned. In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2\u0026#39;s complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825. \u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100 Output: 964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000) Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000. Example 2:\nInput: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101 Output: 3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111) Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe input must be a binary string of length 32 \u0026nbsp;\nFollow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?\nRelated Topics Bit Manipulation Divide and Conquer Similar Questions Reverse Integer Number of 1 Bits A Number After a Double Reversal "}
