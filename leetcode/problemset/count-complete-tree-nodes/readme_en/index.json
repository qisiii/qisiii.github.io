Count Complete Tree Nodes Description Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.\nAccording to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.\nDesign an algorithm that runs in less than\u0026nbsp;O(n)\u0026nbsp;time complexity.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6] Output: 6 Example 2:\nInput: root = [] Output: 0 Example 3:\nInput: root = [1] Output: 1 \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 104]. 0 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 5 * 104 The tree is guaranteed to be complete.
