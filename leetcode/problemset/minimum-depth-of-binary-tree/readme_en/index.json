Minimum Depth of Binary Tree Description Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.\nThe minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.\nNote:\u0026nbsp;A leaf is a node with no children.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] Output: 2 Example 2:\nInput: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6] Output: 5 \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 105]. -1000 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 1000 Related Topics Tree Depth-First Search Breadth-First Search Binary Tree Similar Questions Binary Tree Level Order Traversal Maximum Depth of Binary Tree "}
