Find Good Days to Rob the Bank Description You and a gang of thieves are planning on robbing a bank. You are given a 0-indexed integer array security, where security[i] is the number of guards on duty on the ith day. The days are numbered starting from 0. You are also given an integer time.\nThe ith day is a good day to rob the bank if:\nThere are at least time days before and after the ith day, The number of guards at the bank for the time days before i are non-increasing, and The number of guards at the bank for the time days after i are non-decreasing. More formally, this means day i is a good day to rob the bank if and only if security[i - time] \u0026gt;= security[i - time + 1] \u0026gt;= ... \u0026gt;= security[i] \u0026lt;= ... \u0026lt;= security[i + time - 1] \u0026lt;= security[i + time].\nReturn a list of all days (0-indexed) that are good days to rob the bank. The order that the days are returned in does not matter.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: security = [5,3,3,3,5,6,2], time = 2 Output: [2,3] Explanation: On day 2, we have security[0] \u0026gt;= security[1] \u0026gt;= security[2] \u0026lt;= security[3] \u0026lt;= security[4]. On day 3, we have security[1] \u0026gt;= security[2] \u0026gt;= security[3] \u0026lt;= security[4] \u0026lt;= security[5]. No other days satisfy this condition, so days 2 and 3 are the only good days to rob the bank. Example 2:\nInput: security = [1,1,1,1,1], time = 0 Output: [0,1,2,3,4] Explanation: Since time equals 0, every day is a good day to rob the bank, so return every day. Example 3:\nInput: security = [1,2,3,4,5,6], time = 2 Output: [] Explanation: No day has 2 days before it that have a non-increasing number of guards. Thus, no day is a good day to rob the bank, so return an empty list. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= security.length \u0026lt;= 105 0 \u0026lt;= security[i], time \u0026lt;= 105 Related Topics Array Dynamic Programming Prefix Sum Similar Questions Non-decreasing Array Longest Mountain in Array Find in Mountain Array Maximum Ascending Subarray Sum Find All Good Indices "}
