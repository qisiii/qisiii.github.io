Reverse Words in a String Description Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.\nA word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.\nReturn a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.\nNote that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: s = \u0026quot;the sky is blue\u0026quot; Output: \u0026quot;blue is sky the\u0026quot; Example 2:\nInput: s = \u0026quot; hello world \u0026quot; Output: \u0026quot;world hello\u0026quot; Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces. Example 3:\nInput: s = \u0026quot;a good example\u0026quot; Output: \u0026quot;example good a\u0026quot; Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= s.length \u0026lt;= 104 s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces \u0026#39; \u0026#39;. There is at least one word in s. \u0026nbsp;\nFollow-up:\u0026nbsp;If the string data type is mutable in your language, can\u0026nbsp;you solve it\u0026nbsp;in-place\u0026nbsp;with\u0026nbsp;O(1)\u0026nbsp;extra space?\nRelated Topics Two Pointers String Similar Questions Reverse Words in a String II "}
