Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree Description Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.\nAccording to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: \u0026ldquo;The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8 Output: 6 Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Example 2:\nInput: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4 Output: 2 Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition. Example 3:\nInput: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1 Output: 2 \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105]. -109 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 109 All Node.val are unique. p != q p and q will exist in the BST.
