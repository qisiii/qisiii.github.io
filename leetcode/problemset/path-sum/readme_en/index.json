Path Sum Description Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.\nA leaf is a node with no children.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22 Output: true Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown. Example 2:\nInput: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5 Output: false Explanation: There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree: (1 --\u0026gt; 2): The sum is 3. (1 --\u0026gt; 3): The sum is 4. There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5. Example 3:\nInput: root = [], targetSum = 0 Output: false Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000]. -1000 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 1000 -1000 \u0026lt;= targetSum \u0026lt;= 1000 Related Topics Tree Depth-First Search Breadth-First Search Binary Tree Similar Questions Path Sum II Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum Sum Root to Leaf Numbers Path Sum III Path Sum IV "}
