Minimum Window Substring Description Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string \u0026quot;\u0026quot;.\nThe testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: s = \u0026quot;ADOBECODEBANC\u0026quot;, t = \u0026quot;ABC\u0026quot; Output: \u0026quot;BANC\u0026quot; Explanation: The minimum window substring \u0026quot;BANC\u0026quot; includes \u0026#39;A\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;, and \u0026#39;C\u0026#39; from string t. Example 2:\nInput: s = \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, t = \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; Output: \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window. Example 3:\nInput: s = \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, t = \u0026quot;aa\u0026quot; Output: \u0026quot;\u0026quot; Explanation: Both \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;s from t must be included in the window. Since the largest window of s only has one \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;, return empty string. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nm == s.length n == t.length 1 \u0026lt;= m, n \u0026lt;= 105 s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters. \u0026nbsp;\nFollow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?\nRelated Topics Hash Table String Sliding Window Similar Questions Substring with Concatenation of All Words Minimum Size Subarray Sum Sliding Window Maximum Permutation in String Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists Minimum Window Subsequence Count Substrings That Can Be Rearranged to Contain a String II Count Substrings That Can Be Rearranged to Contain a String I "}
