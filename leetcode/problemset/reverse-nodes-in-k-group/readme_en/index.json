Reverse Nodes in k-Group Description Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.\nk is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.\nYou may not alter the values in the list\u0026#39;s nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2 Output: [2,1,4,3,5] Example 2:\nInput: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3 Output: [3,2,1,4,5] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the list is n. 1 \u0026lt;= k \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 5000 0 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 1000 \u0026nbsp;\nFollow-up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra memory space?\nRelated Topics Recursion Linked List Similar Questions Swap Nodes in Pairs Swapping Nodes in a Linked List Reverse Nodes in Even Length Groups "}
