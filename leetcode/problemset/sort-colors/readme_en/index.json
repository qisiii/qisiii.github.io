Sort Colors Description Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.\nWe will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.\nYou must solve this problem without using the library\u0026#39;s sort function.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0] Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2] Example 2:\nInput: nums = [2,0,1] Output: [0,1,2] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nn == nums.length 1 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 300 nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2. \u0026nbsp;\nFollow up:\u0026nbsp;Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only\u0026nbsp;constant extra space?\nRelated Topics Array Two Pointers Sorting Similar Questions Sort List Wiggle Sort Wiggle Sort II "}
