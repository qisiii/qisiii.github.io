You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.\nFind and return the maximum profit you can achieve.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4] Output: 7 Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3. Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
