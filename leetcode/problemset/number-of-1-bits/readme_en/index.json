Number of 1 Bits Description Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of set bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 11\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nThe input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 128\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\nThe input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 2147483645\nOutput: 30\nExplanation:\nThe input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.\n\u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 231 - 1 \u0026nbsp;\nFollow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
