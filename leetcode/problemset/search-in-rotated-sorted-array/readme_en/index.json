Search in Rotated Sorted Array Description There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).\nPrior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 \u0026lt;= k \u0026lt; nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].\nGiven the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.\nYou must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0 Output: 4 Example 2:\nInput: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3 Output: -1 Example 3:\nInput: nums = [1], target = 0 Output: -1 \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 5000 -104 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 104 All values of nums are unique. nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated. -104 \u0026lt;= target \u0026lt;= 104 Related Topics Array Binary Search Similar Questions Search in Rotated Sorted Array II Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array Pour Water Between Buckets to Make Water Levels Equal "}
