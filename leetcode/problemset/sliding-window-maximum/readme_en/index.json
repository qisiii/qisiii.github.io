Sliding Window Maximum Description You are given an array of integers\u0026nbsp;nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.\nReturn the max sliding window.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3 Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7] Explanation: Window position Max --------------- ----- [1 3 -1] -3 5 3 6 7 3 1 [3 -1 -3] 5 3 6 7 3 1 3 [-1 -3 5] 3 6 7 5 1 3 -1 [-3 5 3] 6 7 5 1 3 -1 -3 [5 3 6] 7 6 1 3 -1 -3 5 [3 6 7] 7 Example 2:\nInput: nums = [1], k = 1 Output: [1] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 105 -104 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 104 1 \u0026lt;= k \u0026lt;= nums.length Related Topics Queue Array Sliding Window Monotonic Queue Heap (Priority Queue) Similar Questions Minimum Window Substring Min Stack Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters Paint House II Jump Game VI Maximum Number of Robots Within Budget Maximum Tastiness of Candy Basket Maximal Score After Applying K Operations "}
