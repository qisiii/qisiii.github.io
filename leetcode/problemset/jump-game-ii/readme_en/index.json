Jump Game II Description You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].\nEach element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:\n0 \u0026lt;= j \u0026lt;= nums[i] and i + j \u0026lt; n Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [2,3,1,1,4] Output: 2 Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index. Example 2:\nInput: nums = [2,3,0,1,4] Output: 2 \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 104 0 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 1000 It\u0026#39;s guaranteed that you can reach nums[n - 1].
