Trapping Rain Water Description Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1] Output: 6 Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Example 2:\nInput: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5] Output: 9 \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nn == height.length 1 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 2 * 104 0 \u0026lt;= height[i] \u0026lt;= 105 Related Topics Stack Array Two Pointers Dynamic Programming Monotonic Stack Similar Questions Container With Most Water Product of Array Except Self Trapping Rain Water II Pour Water Maximum Value of an Ordered Triplet II "}
