Search in a Binary Search Tree Description You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.\nFind the node in the BST that the node\u0026#39;s value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2 Output: [2,1,3] Example 2:\nInput: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5 Output: [] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 5000]. 1 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 107 root is a binary search tree. 1 \u0026lt;= val \u0026lt;= 107 Related Topics Tree Binary Search Tree Binary Tree Similar Questions Closest Binary Search Tree Value Insert into a Binary Search Tree Closest Nodes Queries in a Binary Search Tree "}
