Bulb Switcher Description There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs, then\u0026nbsp;you turn off every second bulb.\nOn the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it\u0026#39;s off or turning off if it\u0026#39;s on). For the ith round, you toggle every i bulb. For the nth round, you only toggle the last bulb.\nReturn the number of bulbs that are on after n rounds.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 3 Output: 1 Explanation: At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off]. After the first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on]. After the second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on]. After the third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. So you should return 1 because there is only one bulb is on. Example 2:\nInput: n = 0 Output: 0 Example 3:\nInput: n = 1 Output: 1 \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n0 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 109 Related Topics Brainteaser Math Similar Questions Bulb Switcher II Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips Number of Times Binary String Is Prefix-Aligned Find the Pivot Integer "}
