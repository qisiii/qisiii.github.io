Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II Description Given the root of a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes\u0026#39; values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] Output: [[15,7],[9,20],[3]] Example 2:\nInput: root = [1] Output: [[1]] Example 3:\nInput: root = [] Output: [] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000]. -1000 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 1000 Related Topics Tree Breadth-First Search Binary Tree Similar Questions Binary Tree Level Order Traversal Average of Levels in Binary Tree "}
