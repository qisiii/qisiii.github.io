Coin Change Description You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.\nReturn the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.\nYou may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11 Output: 3 Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1 Example 2:\nInput: coins = [2], amount = 3 Output: -1 Example 3:\nInput: coins = [1], amount = 0 Output: 0 \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= coins.length \u0026lt;= 12 1 \u0026lt;= coins[i] \u0026lt;= 231 - 1 0 \u0026lt;= amount \u0026lt;= 104 Related Topics Breadth-First Search Array Dynamic Programming Similar Questions Minimum Cost For Tickets Maximum Value of K Coins From Piles Minimum Number of Operations to Convert Time Minimum Cost to Split an Array Count of Sub-Multisets With Bounded Sum Length of the Longest Subsequence That Sums to Target Minimum Number of Coins to be Added Most Expensive Item That Can Not Be Bought "}
