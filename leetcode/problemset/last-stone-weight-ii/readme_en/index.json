Last Stone Weight II Description You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.\nWe are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x \u0026lt;= y. The result of this smash is:\nIf x == y, both stones are destroyed, and If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x. At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.\nReturn the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1] Output: 1 Explanation: We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then, we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1, so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then, we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1, so the array converts to [1,1,1] then, we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0, so the array converts to [1], then that\u0026#39;s the optimal value. Example 2:\nInput: stones = [31,26,33,21,40] Output: 5 \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= stones.length \u0026lt;= 30 1 \u0026lt;= stones[i] \u0026lt;= 100 Related Topics Array Dynamic Programming Similar Questions Partition Array Into Two Arrays to Minimize Sum Difference "}
