Sqrt(x) Description Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.\nYou must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.\nFor example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python. \u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: x = 4 Output: 2 Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2. Example 2:\nInput: x = 8 Output: 2 Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n0 \u0026lt;= x \u0026lt;= 231 - 1 Related Topics Math Binary Search Similar Questions Pow(x, n) Valid Perfect Square "}
