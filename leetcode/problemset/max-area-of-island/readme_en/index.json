Max Area of Island Description You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1\u0026#39;s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.\nThe area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.\nReturn the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]] Output: 6 Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally. Example 2:\nInput: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]] Output: 0 \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nm == grid.length n == grid[i].length 1 \u0026lt;= m, n \u0026lt;= 50 grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
