Longest Nice Subarray Description You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.\nWe call a subarray of nums nice if the bitwise AND of every pair of elements that are in different positions in the subarray is equal to 0.\nReturn the length of the longest nice subarray.\nA subarray is a contiguous part of an array.\nNote that subarrays of length 1 are always considered nice.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,3,8,48,10] Output: 3 Explanation: The longest nice subarray is [3,8,48]. This subarray satisfies the conditions: - 3 AND 8 = 0. - 3 AND 48 = 0. - 8 AND 48 = 0. It can be proven that no longer nice subarray can be obtained, so we return 3. Example 2:\nInput: nums = [3,1,5,11,13] Output: 1 Explanation: The length of the longest nice subarray is 1. Any subarray of length 1 can be chosen. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 105 1 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 109 Related Topics Bit Manipulation Array Sliding Window Similar Questions Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters Bitwise AND of Numbers Range Bitwise ORs of Subarrays Fruit Into Baskets Max Consecutive Ones III Get Equal Substrings Within Budget Frequency of the Most Frequent Element Longest Substring Of All Vowels in Order Maximize the Confusion of an Exam Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K "}
