Find Mode in Binary Search Tree Description Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the mode(s) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it.\nIf the tree has more than one mode, return them in any order.\nAssume a BST is defined as follows:\nThe left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node\u0026#39;s key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node\u0026#39;s key. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. \u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [1,null,2,2] Output: [2] Example 2:\nInput: root = [0] Output: [0] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104]. -105 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 105 \u0026nbsp;\nFollow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count). Related Topics Tree Depth-First Search Binary Search Tree Binary Tree Similar Questions Validate Binary Search Tree "}
