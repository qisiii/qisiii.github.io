Assign Cookies Description Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.\nEach child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] \u0026gt;= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1] Output: 1 Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content. You need to output 1. Example 2:\nInput: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3] Output: 2 Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, You need to output 2. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= g.length \u0026lt;= 3 * 104 0 \u0026lt;= s.length \u0026lt;= 3 * 104 1 \u0026lt;= g[i], s[j] \u0026lt;= 231 - 1 \u0026nbsp;\nNote: This question is the same as 2410: Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers.\nRelated Topics Greedy Array Two Pointers Sorting Similar Questions "}
