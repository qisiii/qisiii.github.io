Average of Levels in Binary Tree Description Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted. \u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000] Explanation: The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3, on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11. Hence return [3, 14.5, 11]. Example 2:\nInput: root = [3,9,20,15,7] Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104]. -231 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 231 - 1 Related Topics Tree Depth-First Search Breadth-First Search Binary Tree Similar Questions Binary Tree Level Order Traversal Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II "}
