Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array Description Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.\nConsider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:\nChange the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums. Return k. Custom Judge:\nThe judge will test your solution with the following code:\nint[] nums = [...]; // Input array int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation assert k == expectedNums.length; for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; k; i++) { assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i]; } If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,1,2] Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_] Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores). Example 2:\nInput: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4] Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_] Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores). \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 3 * 104 -100 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 100 nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
