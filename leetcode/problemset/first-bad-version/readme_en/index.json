First Bad Version Description You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.\nSuppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.\nYou are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 5, bad = 4 Output: 4 Explanation: call isBadVersion(3) -\u0026gt; false call isBadVersion(5)\u0026nbsp;-\u0026gt; true call isBadVersion(4)\u0026nbsp;-\u0026gt; true Then 4 is the first bad version. Example 2:\nInput: n = 1, bad = 1 Output: 1 \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= bad \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 231 - 1 Related Topics Binary Search Interactive Similar Questions Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array Search Insert Position Guess Number Higher or Lower "}
