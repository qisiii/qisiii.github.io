Find Maximum Number of String Pairs Description You are given a 0-indexed array words consisting of distinct strings.\nThe string words[i] can be paired with the string words[j] if:\nThe string words[i] is equal to the reversed string of words[j]. 0 \u0026lt;= i \u0026lt; j \u0026lt; words.length. Return the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the array words.\nNote that\u0026nbsp;each string can belong in\u0026nbsp;at most one pair.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: words = [\u0026quot;cd\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;ac\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;dc\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;ca\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;zz\u0026quot;] Output: 2 Explanation: In this example, we can form 2 pair of strings in the following way: - We pair the 0th string with the 2nd string, as the reversed string of word[0] is \u0026quot;dc\u0026quot; and is equal to words[2]. - We pair the 1st string with the 3rd string, as the reversed string of word[1] is \u0026quot;ca\u0026quot; and is equal to words[3]. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed. Example 2:\nInput: words = [\u0026quot;ab\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;ba\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;cc\u0026quot;] Output: 1 Explanation: In this example, we can form 1 pair of strings in the following way: - We pair the 0th string with the 1st string, as the reversed string of words[1] is \u0026quot;ab\u0026quot; and is equal to words[0]. It can be proven that 1 is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed. Example 3:\nInput: words = [\u0026quot;aa\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;ab\u0026quot;] Output: 0 Explanation: In this example, we are unable to form any pair of strings. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= words.length \u0026lt;= 50 words[i].length == 2 words\u0026nbsp;consists of distinct strings. words[i]\u0026nbsp;contains only lowercase English letters.
