Next Greater Element II Description Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every element in nums.\nThe next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn\u0026#39;t exist, return -1 for this number.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,2,1] Output: [2,-1,2] Explanation: The first 1\u0026#39;s next greater number is 2; The number 2 can\u0026#39;t find next greater number. The second 1\u0026#39;s next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2. Example 2:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,3] Output: [2,3,4,-1,4] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 104 -109 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 109 Related Topics Stack Array Monotonic Stack Similar Questions Next Greater Element I Next Greater Element III "}
