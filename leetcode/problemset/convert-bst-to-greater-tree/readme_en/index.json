Convert BST to Greater Tree Description Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.\nAs a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:\nThe left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node\u0026#39;s key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node\u0026#39;s key. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. \u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8] Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8] Example 2:\nInput: root = [0,null,1] Output: [1,null,1] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104]. -104 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 104 All the values in the tree are unique. root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree. \u0026nbsp;\nNote: This question is the same as 1038: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/\nRelated Topics Tree Depth-First Search Binary Search Tree Binary Tree Similar Questions "}
