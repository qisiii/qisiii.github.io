Search a 2D Matrix II Description Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:\nIntegers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right. Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom. \u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5 Output: true Example 2:\nInput: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20 Output: false \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nm == matrix.length n == matrix[i].length 1 \u0026lt;= n, m \u0026lt;= 300 -109 \u0026lt;= matrix[i][j] \u0026lt;= 109 All the integers in each row are sorted in ascending order. All the integers in each column are sorted in ascending order. -109 \u0026lt;= target \u0026lt;= 109 Related Topics Array Binary Search Divide and Conquer Matrix Similar Questions Search a 2D Matrix "}
