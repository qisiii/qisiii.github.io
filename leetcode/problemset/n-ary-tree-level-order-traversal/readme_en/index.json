N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal Description Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes\u0026#39; values.\nNary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6] Output: [[1],[3,2,4],[5,6]] Example 2:\nInput: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14] Output: [[1],[2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10],[11,12,13],[14]] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000 The total number of nodes is between [0, 104] Related Topics Tree Breadth-First Search Similar Questions Binary Tree Level Order Traversal N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal The Time When the Network Becomes Idle "}
