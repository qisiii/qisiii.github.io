Binary Tree Level Order Traversal Description Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes\u0026#39; values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]] Example 2:\nInput: root = [1] Output: [[1]] Example 3:\nInput: root = [] Output: [] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000]. -1000 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 1000 Related Topics Tree Breadth-First Search Binary Tree Similar Questions Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II Minimum Depth of Binary Tree Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal Average of Levels in Binary Tree N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal Cousins in Binary Tree Minimum Number of Operations to Sort a Binary Tree by Level Divide Nodes Into the Maximum Number of Groups "}
