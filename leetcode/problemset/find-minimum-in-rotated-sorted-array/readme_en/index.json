Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array Description Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:\n[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times. [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times. Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].\nGiven the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in\u0026nbsp;O(log n) time.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [3,4,5,1,2] Output: 1 Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times. Example 2:\nInput: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] Output: 0 Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times. Example 3:\nInput: nums = [11,13,15,17] Output: 11 Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nn == nums.length 1 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 5000 -5000 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 5000 All the integers of nums are unique. nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.
