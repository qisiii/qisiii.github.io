Container With Most Water Description You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).\nFind two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.\nReturn the maximum amount of water a container can store.\nNotice that you may not slant the container.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7] Output: 49 Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49. Example 2:\nInput: height = [1,1] Output: 1 \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nn == height.length 2 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 105 0 \u0026lt;= height[i] \u0026lt;= 104 Related Topics Greedy Array Two Pointers Similar Questions Trapping Rain Water Maximum Tastiness of Candy Basket House Robber IV "}
