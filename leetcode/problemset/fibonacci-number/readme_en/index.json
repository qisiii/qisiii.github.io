Fibonacci Number Description The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,\nF(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n \u0026gt; 1. Given n, calculate F(n).\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 2 Output: 1 Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1. Example 2:\nInput: n = 3 Output: 2 Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2. Example 3:\nInput: n = 4 Output: 3 Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n0 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 30 Related Topics Recursion Memoization Math Dynamic Programming Similar Questions Climbing Stairs Split Array into Fibonacci Sequence Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence N-th Tribonacci Number "}
