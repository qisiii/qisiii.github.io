Simplify Path Description You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash \u0026#39;/\u0026#39;. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.\nThe rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:\nA single period \u0026#39;.\u0026#39; represents the current directory. A double period \u0026#39;..\u0026#39; represents the previous/parent directory. Multiple consecutive slashes such as \u0026#39;//\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;///\u0026#39; are treated as a single slash \u0026#39;/\u0026#39;. Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, \u0026#39;...\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;....\u0026#39; are valid directory or file names. The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:\nThe path must start with a single slash \u0026#39;/\u0026#39;. Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash \u0026#39;/\u0026#39;. The path must not end with a slash \u0026#39;/\u0026#39;, unless it is the root directory. The path must not have any single or double periods (\u0026#39;.\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;..\u0026#39;) used to denote current or parent directories. Return the simplified canonical path.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: path = \u0026quot;/home/\u0026quot;\nOutput: \u0026quot;/home\u0026quot;\nExplanation:\nThe trailing slash should be removed.\nExample 2:\nInput: path = \u0026quot;/home//foo/\u0026quot;\nOutput: \u0026quot;/home/foo\u0026quot;\nExplanation:\nMultiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.\nExample 3:\nInput: path = \u0026quot;/home/user/Documents/../Pictures\u0026quot;\nOutput: \u0026quot;/home/user/Pictures\u0026quot;\nExplanation:\nA double period \u0026quot;..\u0026quot; refers to the directory up a level (the parent directory).\nExample 4:\nInput: path = \u0026quot;/../\u0026quot;\nOutput: \u0026quot;/\u0026quot;\nExplanation:\nGoing one level up from the root directory is not possible.\nExample 5:\nInput: path = \u0026quot;/.../a/../b/c/../d/./\u0026quot;\nOutput: \u0026quot;/.../b/d\u0026quot;\nExplanation:\n\u0026quot;...\u0026quot; is a valid name for a directory in this problem.\n\u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= path.length \u0026lt;= 3000 path consists of English letters, digits, period \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, slash \u0026#39;/\u0026#39; or \u0026#39;_\u0026#39;. path is a valid absolute Unix path.
