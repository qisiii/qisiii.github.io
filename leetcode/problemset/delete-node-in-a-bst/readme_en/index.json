Delete Node in a BST Description Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.\nBasically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:\nSearch for a node to remove. If the node is found, delete the node. \u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3 Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7] Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it. One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST. Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it\u0026#39;s also accepted. Example 2:\nInput: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0 Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7] Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0. Example 3:\nInput: root = [], key = 0 Output: [] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104]. -105 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 105 Each node has a unique value. root is a valid binary search tree. -105 \u0026lt;= key \u0026lt;= 105 \u0026nbsp;\nFollow up: Could you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?\nRelated Topics Tree Binary Search Tree Binary Tree Similar Questions Split BST "}
