Jump Game Description You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array\u0026#39;s first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.\nReturn true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [2,3,1,1,4] Output: true Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index. Example 2:\nInput: nums = [3,2,1,0,4] Output: false Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 104 0 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 105 Related Topics Greedy Array Dynamic Programming Similar Questions Jump Game II Jump Game III Jump Game VII Jump Game VIII Minimum Number of Visited Cells in a Grid Largest Element in an Array after Merge Operations "}
