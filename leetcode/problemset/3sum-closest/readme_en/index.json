(-1 + 2 + 1 = 2). Example 2:\nInput: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1 Output: 0 Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0). \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n3 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 500 -1000 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 1000 -104 \u0026lt;= target \u0026lt;= 104 Related Topics Array Two Pointers Sorting Similar Questions 3Sum 3Sum Smaller "}
