Validate Binary Search Tree Description Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).\nA valid BST is defined as follows:\nThe left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node\u0026#39;s key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node\u0026#39;s key. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. \u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [2,1,3] Output: true Example 2:\nInput: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6] Output: false Explanation: The root node\u0026#39;s value is 5 but its right child\u0026#39;s value is 4. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104]. -231 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 231 - 1 Related Topics Tree Depth-First Search Binary Search Tree Binary Tree Similar Questions Binary Tree Inorder Traversal Find Mode in Binary Search Tree "}
