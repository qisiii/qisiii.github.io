Unique Paths Description There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.\nGiven the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.\nThe test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: m = 3, n = 7 Output: 28 Example 2:\nInput: m = 3, n = 2 Output: 3 Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner: 1. Right -\u0026gt; Down -\u0026gt; Down 2. Down -\u0026gt; Down -\u0026gt; Right 3. Down -\u0026gt; Right -\u0026gt; Down \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= m, n \u0026lt;= 100 Related Topics Math Dynamic Programming Combinatorics Similar Questions Unique Paths II Minimum Path Sum Dungeon Game Minimum Path Cost in a Grid Minimum Cost Homecoming of a Robot in a Grid Number of Ways to Reach a Position After Exactly k Steps Paths in Matrix Whose Sum Is Divisible by K "}
