Top K Frequent Elements Description Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2 Output: [1,2] Example 2:\nInput: nums = [1], k = 1 Output: [1] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 105 -104 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 104 k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array]. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique. \u0026nbsp;\nFollow up: Your algorithm\u0026#39;s time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array\u0026#39;s size.\nRelated Topics Array Hash Table Divide and Conquer Bucket Sort Counting Quickselect Sorting Heap (Priority Queue) Similar Questions Word Frequency Kth Largest Element in an Array Sort Characters By Frequency Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences Top K Frequent Words K Closest Points to Origin Sort Features by Popularity Sender With Largest Word Count Most Frequent Even Element Linked List Frequency "}
