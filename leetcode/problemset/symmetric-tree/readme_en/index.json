Symmetric Tree Description Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] Output: true Example 2:\nInput: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] Output: false \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000]. -100 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 100 \u0026nbsp;\nFollow up: Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
