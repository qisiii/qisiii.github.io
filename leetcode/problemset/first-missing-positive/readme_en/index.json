First Missing Positive Description Given an unsorted integer array nums. Return the smallest positive integer that is not present in nums.\nYou must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) auxiliary space.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,2,0] Output: 3 Explanation: The numbers in the range [1,2] are all in the array. Example 2:\nInput: nums = [3,4,-1,1] Output: 2 Explanation: 1 is in the array but 2 is missing. Example 3:\nInput: nums = [7,8,9,11,12] Output: 1 Explanation: The smallest positive integer 1 is missing. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 105 -231 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 231 - 1 Related Topics Array Hash Table Similar Questions Missing Number Find the Duplicate Number Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array Couples Holding Hands Smallest Number in Infinite Set Maximum Number of Integers to Choose From a Range I Smallest Missing Non-negative Integer After Operations Maximum Number of Integers to Choose From a Range II Smallest Missing Integer Greater Than Sequential Prefix Sum "}
