Next Greater Element I Description The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.\nYou are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.\nFor each 0 \u0026lt;= i \u0026lt; nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.\nReturn an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2] Output: [-1,3,-1] Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows: - 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1. - 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3. - 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1. Example 2:\nInput: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4] Output: [3,-1] Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows: - 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3. - 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= nums1.length \u0026lt;= nums2.length \u0026lt;= 1000 0 \u0026lt;= nums1[i], nums2[i] \u0026lt;= 104 All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique. All the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2. \u0026nbsp;\nFollow up: Could you find an O(nums1.length + nums2.length) solution?
