Insert into a Binary Search Tree Description You are given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to insert into the tree. Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.\nNotice\u0026nbsp;that there may exist\u0026nbsp;multiple valid ways for the\u0026nbsp;insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return any of them.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5 Output: [4,2,7,1,3,5] Explanation: Another accepted tree is: Example 2:\nInput: root = [40,20,60,10,30,50,70], val = 25 Output: [40,20,60,10,30,50,70,null,null,25] Example 3:\nInput: root = [4,2,7,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,null], val = 5 Output: [4,2,7,1,3,5] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in\u0026nbsp;the tree will be in the range [0,\u0026nbsp;104]. -108 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 108 All the values Node.val are unique. -108 \u0026lt;= val \u0026lt;= 108 It\u0026#39;s guaranteed that val does not exist in the original BST.
