Recover Binary Search Tree Description You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [1,3,null,null,2] Output: [3,1,null,null,2] Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 \u0026gt; 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid. Example 2:\nInput: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2] Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3] Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 \u0026lt; 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 1000]. -231 \u0026lt;= Node.val \u0026lt;= 231 - 1 \u0026nbsp;\nFollow up: A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight-forward. Could you devise a constant O(1) space solution? Related Topics Tree Depth-First Search Binary Search Tree Binary Tree Similar Questions "}
