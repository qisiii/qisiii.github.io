Coin Change II Description You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.\nReturn the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.\nYou may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.\nThe answer is guaranteed to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5] Output: 4 Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount: 5=5 5=2+2+1 5=2+1+1+1 5=1+1+1+1+1 Example 2:\nInput: amount = 3, coins = [2] Output: 0 Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2. Example 3:\nInput: amount = 10, coins = [10] Output: 1 \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= coins.length \u0026lt;= 300 1 \u0026lt;= coins[i] \u0026lt;= 5000 All the values of coins are unique. 0 \u0026lt;= amount \u0026lt;= 5000 Related Topics Array Dynamic Programming Similar Questions Maximum Value of K Coins From Piles Number of Ways to Earn Points Count of Sub-Multisets With Bounded Sum Length of the Longest Subsequence That Sums to Target The Number of Ways to Make the Sum "}
