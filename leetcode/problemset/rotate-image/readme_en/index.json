Rotate Image Description You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).\nYou have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]] Example 2:\nInput: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]] Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\nn == matrix.length == matrix[i].length 1 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 20 -1000 \u0026lt;= matrix[i][j] \u0026lt;= 1000 Related Topics Array Math Matrix Similar Questions Determine Whether Matrix Can Be Obtained By Rotation "}
