Combination Sum III Description Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:\nOnly numbers 1 through 9 are used. Each number is used at most once. Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: k = 3, n = 7 Output: [[1,2,4]] Explanation: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 There are no other valid combinations. Example 2:\nInput: k = 3, n = 9 Output: [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]] Explanation: 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 There are no other valid combinations. Example 3:\nInput: k = 4, n = 1 Output: [] Explanation: There are no valid combinations. Using 4 different numbers in the range [1,9], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 \u0026gt; 1, there are no valid combination. \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n2 \u0026lt;= k \u0026lt;= 9 1 \u0026lt;= n \u0026lt;= 60 Related Topics Array Backtracking Similar Questions Combination Sum "}
