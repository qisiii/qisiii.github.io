Rotate Array Description Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3 Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4] Explanation: rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6] rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5] rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4] Example 2:\nInput: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2 Output: [3,99,-1,-100] Explanation: rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3] rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100] \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 105 -231 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 231 - 1 0 \u0026lt;= k \u0026lt;= 105 \u0026nbsp;\nFollow up:\nTry to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem. Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
