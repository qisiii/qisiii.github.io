Combination Sum IV Description Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return the number of possible combinations that add up to\u0026nbsp;target.\nThe test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer.\n\u0026nbsp;\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4 Output: 7 Explanation: The possible combination ways are: (1, 1, 1, 1) (1, 1, 2) (1, 2, 1) (1, 3) (2, 1, 1) (2, 2) (3, 1) Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations. Example 2:\nInput: nums = [9], target = 3 Output: 0 \u0026nbsp;\nConstraints:\n1 \u0026lt;= nums.length \u0026lt;= 200 1 \u0026lt;= nums[i] \u0026lt;= 1000 All the elements of nums are unique. 1 \u0026lt;= target \u0026lt;= 1000 \u0026nbsp;\nFollow up: What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?\nRelated Topics Array Dynamic Programming Similar Questions Combination Sum Ways to Express an Integer as Sum of Powers "}
